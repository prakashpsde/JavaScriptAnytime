Event Delegation:
Event delegation is a technique in which you attach a single event listener to a parent rather than multiple listeners to each child.
Memory usage and improves performance, especially for large lists or dynamically generated content.
Example 01:
document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  if (event.target.matches('li')) {
    console.log('You clicked on an li element!');
  }
});
